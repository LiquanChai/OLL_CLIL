    "\n",
    "This week we are going to extend the visualization examples from last time. Python has plenty of pre-coded visualizations coming in different packages. A list of the most important graphics, alongside with pointers to their code and exampls, is founud here: https://python-graph-gallery.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several packages for visualiztion: https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important ones probably are:\n",
    "* Seaborn: https://seaborn.pydata.org (standard statistical graphics)\n",
    "* Boketh: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest (simple interactive visualiztions)\n",
    "* ggplot: http://ggplot.yhathq.com\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to use **Seaborn**, since it provides most of the stuff we will need in the course and is very simple to use. For more sophisticated visualizations that go beyond these libraries, please check the Java Script libraries D3 (https://d3js.org) or Processing (https://processing.org) for Java."
